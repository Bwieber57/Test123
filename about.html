            Ella, I just wanted to let you know that I started this project on August 19th 2021.
            This is for your mom and I to write to you as the years go by.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope you find joy in reading our experience, point of view, jokes or whatever it is that        comes to mind.
            If there is one thing we hope you take from this, is that we love you beyond anything.
            We will always be here for you and we will always do what is best for you.
        </p>
